Search for your favorite movies in MovieLand<br>
"MovieLand" is a web-based [application](https://movie-land-production.up.railway.app/) built using the OMDb API - The Open Movie Database API, HTML, CSS, and the React framework with JavaScript. The app searches for a given movie title using the OMDb API - The Open Movie Database API through an asynchronous fetch and returns the response as JSON to return an array of movie objects that match the given title unless nothing is found.  A useState for the searchTerm ('') and movies([]) are defined initially and are used later in the code to dynamically alter the state of out React virtual dom. Typing a movie title into the search(<input/>) bar triggers the onChange event listener which sets the search term to the user's value. A second event listener listens for when the user selects enter (onKeyDown) and if the search icon is selected the event listener onClick is triggered which takes a callback function and calls the searchMovies method which takes the searchTerm as an argument. If a movie exists, the movie is mapped to the MovieCard Component (MovieCard.jsx) which serves as a template for dynamically rendering the movie's poster, type, title, and year. If no movie is found "No movies found" is printed.
